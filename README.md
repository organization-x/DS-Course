# DS-Course
A case study put together by instructor Cameron Jackson. Note that this is an advanced version of this project.

## 📃 Outline of the project

## 🤔Laying the foundation for your project 

## 🔎 Finding and collecting data

## 🧼 Cleaning the Data
To see just how different and dirty real world data can be, look through section 1 and section 2 of the notebook: [https://github.com/organization-x/DS-Course/blob/main/DS_Merged_Data_Exploration.ipynb](https://github.com/organization-x/DS-Course/blob/main/DS_Merged_Data_Exploration.ipynb) 
To summarize how messy the above data is, the different datasets that we were merging had several problems that I’ll list below:

1. Different Naming conventions between datasets, ie using “&” vs writing out “and”
2. Random extra spacing in the different names of countries
3. Using outdated names of countries, requiring looking up countries histories to figure out what the datasets were referring to
4. Including or excluding certain territories without any noticeable pattern
5. Missing data in certain columns

## 📠 Choosing your ML model / Training the model

## 🥇Comparing different models

## ✨ Iterate!

## Extension: Deploying a DS Project to the Web
This is not covered by this walkthrough.

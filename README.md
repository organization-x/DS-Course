# DS-Course
A case study put together by instructor Cameron Jackson. Note that this is an advanced version of this project.

NOTE: This a very advanced version of the project and that it is acceptable and expected to do a much simpler version of the project.

## 📃 Outline of the project

## 🤔Laying the foundation for your project 

## 🔎 Finding and collecting data

## 🧼 Cleaning the Data
To see just how different and dirty real world data can be, look through section 1 and section 2 of the notebook: [https://github.com/organization-x/DS-Course/blob/main/DS_Merged_Data_Exploration.ipynb](https://github.com/organization-x/DS-Course/blob/main/DS_Merged_Data_Exploration.ipynb) 
To summarize how messy the above data is, the different datasets that we were merging had several problems that I’ll list below:

1. Different Naming conventions between datasets, ie using “&” vs writing out “and”
2. Random extra spacing in the different names of countries
3. Using outdated names of countries, requiring looking up countries histories to figure out what the datasets were referring to
4. Including or excluding certain territories without any noticeable pattern
5. Missing data in certain columns

We will be using the pandas python library to manage all of our data needs throughout our project so I recommend becoming familiar with the library. At this point, you should start looking for different pieces of data that you can use to answer the question you started with. You should start to map out correlations between different pieces of information you have gathered to see if it is relevant to the thesis that you created at the beginning. You can use pandas to show a correlation map between different columns of the data to help start this conversation.
